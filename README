Middleware that handles upon custom exception classes.
The custom exception classes must have a render method, which return a valid response object.
You can still throw regular exceptions which will still be evaluated by django as 404 responses.

USAGE:
    class ProductNotFound(Exception):
        def render(self):
            return HttpResponse("You could ofcourse use render_to_response or any response object")

INSTALLATION:
    pip install -e git+http://github.com/jonasgeiregat/django-excepted.git#django_excepted

    And add django_excepted.middleware.ExceptionHandlingMiddleware to your MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES
